### Overview

This architecture reconstructs the multilabel classification of sentences by leveraging context-specific information construed from their source documents. We hypothesize that jointly learning extractive summarization will improve the performance of sentence classification by concatenating sentence information (classification hidden layers) with source document and context information (summarization hidden layers). This parallels the natural decision making process undertaken by human classification, where a combination of semantics and context inform classification.

### Installation  
Python 3.6 is required and the dependences can be installed with:

 ```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
### Usage

```
python main.py --epochs {} --training_size {} --batch_size {}
```

### Data
Training data is sourced from [Resource Watch](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/), a research project from the World Resources Institute. Sentence relevance to 17 separate classes were hand-coded for 155 environmental policies (~4,000 pages) by a team of domain experts. 8,922 of the ~50,000 sentences were classified as relevant. 

#### Steps

#### 1. General data preparation
Sentences are tokenized with a max word count of 10,000 and encoded with pre-trained GloVe embeddings. Contractions and punctuation are treated as their own word. Sentences are padded to 50 words.

#### 2. Extractive summarization
Data is structured in a 3-dimensional array of the form (docs, sentences, words). 

#### 3. Multilabel sentence classification
Under-represented data classes are augmented with psuedo-random bootstrapping such that the range of class distribution falls within a tunable parameter. A bidirectional GRU and attention with context clayer are used to classify each sentence, with a l2 regularization and recurrent dropout of 0.3. Model fit is measured using top k accuracy on a 20% validation split.
